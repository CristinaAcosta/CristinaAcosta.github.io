                <h3>More About Me</h3>
                <p>
                  I have studied chemistry but have always been interested in web development. I was 10 years old when I made my first web page with HTML and CSS. While I was studying in the university I took computer science  as my minor subject and was introduced to programming. During my studies I was an active member in student associations and became responsible for all kinds of tasks and projects including being a web master. That and my previous interest in web development created a spark to turn my hobby into a career. I took my first steps towards my new career in January 2017.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team. I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or designing.
